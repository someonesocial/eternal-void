            <h2>Reading Exercise: The History of Watching Paint Dry</h2>
            <div class="long-text">
                <p>Chapter 1: The Early Years of Paint Observation</p>
                <p>In the year 1823, a man named Herbert Dullsworth became the first documented person to deliberately watch paint dry for recreational purposes. He sat in his wooden chair for approximately 4 hours and 23 minutes, observing white paint as it slowly transformed from wet to dry on his kitchen wall. Herbert noted in his journal: "The experience was neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It simply was."</p>
                
                <p>Chapter 2: The Golden Age of Paint Watching (1850-1900)</p>
                <p>The mid-19th century saw a surge in paint-watching enthusiasm. Clubs were formed where members would gather to collectively observe drying paint. The most famous of these was the "Society for the Appreciation of Gradual Moisture Evaporation" founded in 1867. Members would take turns reading aloud from dictionaries while watching paint dry, creating what historians now call "the ultimate exercise in purposeful boredom."</p>
                
                <p>Chapter 3: Modern Paint Watching Techniques</p>
                <p>Today's paint watchers employ sophisticated techniques such as: sitting very still, breathing quietly, and maintaining focus on the subtle changes in paint texture. Advanced practitioners can detect moisture evaporation rates with their naked eye, though this skill requires years of dedicated, mind-numbing practice.</p>
                
                <p>Chapter 4: The Philosophy of Paint Observation</p>
                <p>Renowned philosopher Dr. Mundania Tedium wrote extensively about the metaphysical implications of paint watching. In her 847-page thesis "On the Nature of Drying: A Contemplation of Temporal Stasis," she argues that watching paint dry is the purest form of human existence, free from the distractions of joy, excitement, or meaning.</p>
